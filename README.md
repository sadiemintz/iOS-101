**App idea**
Movie is an app that allows movie fans to track, explore, and discuss their favorite films. Users can make personalized lists of movies they've seen and want to see. Users can discover similar films by using the app's suggestions based on their viewing history and preferences. A comments section allows users to talk about movies, post reviews, and interact with other viewers. Additionally, the app contains an interactive map showcasing filming locations, which is ideal for individuals who want to visit popular movie locations throughout the world.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- One of the challenge tasks was locating the required icons and tools in Xcode. Because the icons did not display names or descriptions by default somehow, it was difficult to determine their functions.
